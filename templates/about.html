  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi I'm Zenna! Welcome to my blog: A Hackers
    Guide to the Galaxy. A little about me: I am a freshman
    computer science major attending The University of Texas
    at Dallas and I am a hobbyist software engineer and open 
    source enthusiast. I have a range of interests from functional 
    programming to Extended Berkley Packet Filters and cyber security.
    This blog is where I write about those interests sometimes...
    Today I do a lot of programming in Rust and Haskell. I think
    expressive type systems are beautiful and love languages with them.
    If you would like to reach out to me, please do at:

    And if you would like to help support my content, I do enjoy coffee.
